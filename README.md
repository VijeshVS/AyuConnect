# GenAI Hackathon Winning Project - AI-Assisted Diagnosis Platform

## Overview
Won the **GenAI Hackathon** conducted by the **RVCE ACM Student Chapter** and **ACCELERATE RVCE**! ðŸŽ‰

The hackathon challenged us to build a solution for a problem statement within just 3 hours. We chose a problem focused on assisting doctors in diagnosing a large number of patients efficiently using AI. Our solution integrates AI-driven initial diagnosis with doctor verification for a seamless and effective process.

## Problem Statement
Efficiently diagnose a large number of patients using AI to:
- Reduce workload for doctors.
- Provide patients with faster access to medical insights.
- Maintain accuracy and reliability in medical diagnoses.

## Solution
### Platform Features:
1. **AI-Powered Patient Interaction**
   - Patients interact with an AI for an initial diagnosis.
   - The AI follows a structured process, asking detailed and specific questions about symptoms.
   - Generates a detailed diagnostic report.

2. **Doctor Verification**
   - Doctors review patient reports, including:
     - Personal information.
     - AI-patient conversation.
     - Top predicted diseases.
   - Doctors can:
     - Accept or reject the diagnosis.
     - Provide prescriptions.
     - Add remarks.

3. **Patient Portal**
   - Patients can view:
     - Diagnosis details.
     - Prescriptions.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **AI Integration**: Groq

## Usage
1. **Patient Workflow**:
   - Log in to the platform.
   - Answer the AI's questions about symptoms.
   - Receive a detailed AI-generated report.
2. **Doctor Workflow**:
   - Log in to the platform.
   - Review patient reports.
   - Accept or reject the diagnosis, provide prescriptions, and add remarks.
3. **Patient Access**:
   - View verified diagnosis and prescriptions through the portal.

## How It Works
1. **AI Diagnosis**:
   - Leverages Groq to process patient inputs.
   - Uses a structured question-and-answer process.
   - Predicts potential diseases and generates a detailed report.

2. **Doctor Review**:
   - Ensures AI suggestions are validated by medical professionals.
   - Maintains accountability and reliability in the diagnosis process.

3. **Patient Transparency**:
   - Provides patients with clear and actionable insights.
   - Facilitates easy access to medical records and prescriptions.

## Future Scope
- Expand the AI's database for broader diagnostic capabilities.
- Integrate with electronic health records (EHR) systems.
- Add multi-language support for greater accessibility.
